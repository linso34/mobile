# Mobile Workshop

The objective is to start to get familiar with AWS Mobile services, including AWS Amplify and building a simple chatbot mobile application.

## Building a simple "Hello World!" react native app with Authentication
  ### Prerequisites
  
- [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)/[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/)
- Installing an IDE, such as [Visual Cloud Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
    ```
    npm install -g react-native-cli
    npm install -g create-react-native-app
    ```
- [AWS Mobile CLI](https://github.com/aws/awsmobile-cli)
   ` npm install -g awsmobile-cli `
- (Optional) [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)
    On macOS, it is recommended to install it using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    ` brew install watchman`
- Install and configure AWS Amplify CLI - Follow the step by step guide
    ```
    npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
    amplify configure
    ```
  
### Create the application

- Create a new React Native App (CRNA) using create-react-native-app
` create-react-native-app <appName> `
- cd into your new app dir.
` cd <appName> `
- Eject your react native app (in our examples call it "myapp")
` npm run eject `

```
? How would you like to eject from create-react-native-app? React Native: I'd like a regular React Native project.

We have a couple of questions to ask you about how you'd like to name your app:
? What should your app appear as on a user's home screen? 
? What should your Android Studio and Xcode projects be called? 
```

### Lesson 1 - AWS Amplify and AWS Mobile Hub Introduction

AWS provides 2 services to simplify the development of Mobile applications and especially to create the backend environment in the cloud, AWS Mobile Hub and AWS Amplify.
You the workshop you can use either one of them.

#### 1. AWS Mobile Hub

AWS Mobile Hub provides an integrated console that helps you build, test, and monitor your mobile apps. Use the console to choose the features you want to include in your app. Mobile Hub then provisions and configures the necessary AWS services on your behalf and creates a working sample app for you.

AWS Mobile Hub helps to create the below "features" and the related services in AWS Cloud:

* user-signin - Amazon Cognito
* user-files - Amazon S3 for file storage
* cloud-api - API Gateway and AWS Lambda
* database - Amazon DynamoDB
* analytics - Amazon Pinpoint
* hosting - Amazon S3 and Amazon Cloudfront for static website
* appsync - AWS AppSync
* Conversational Bots - Amazon Lex

This can be done either on the AWS Console or by using the AWS Mobile CLI.

#### Installing & configuring a new mobile hub project.

- Installing the AWS Mobile CLI

`npm i -g awsmobile-cli`
- Configuring the CLI

`awsmobile configure`

If you need to get an accessKeyId & secretAccessKey:

* Visit the IAM Console.
* Click Users in left hand menu.
* Click Add User.
* Give the user a name & choose programatic access as the access type & click next.
* Click Create Group.
* Give the group a name & choose Administrator Access as the access type & click Create Group.
* Click Next & click Create User.
* Copy the accessKeyId & secretAccessKey to the terminal to configure the CLI.

- Creating a new Project

`awsmobile init`

After running the above command you will have a few options:

```Choose default for source directory
Choose default for project's distribution directory
Choose default for build command
Choose default for project's start command
Give the project a name of AmplifyReact
```

Now that the project is successfully created, we can view it in the AWS Console by running the following command:

`awsmobile console`

#### 2. AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify is a JavaScript library for frontend and mobile developers building cloud-enabled applications.
AWS Amplify provides a declarative and easy-to-use interface across different categories of cloud operations. AWS Amplify goes well with any JavaScript based frontend workflow, and React Native for mobile developers.

AWS Amplify helps to create the AWS resources for the below category:

* analytics - To collect analytics data for you app
* API - For HTTP requests to REST and GraphQL endpoints
* Authentication - To provide Authentication APIs
* function - To provide backend integration with AWS Lambda, AWS API-Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB
* hosting - To provide an hosting solution for static files on Amazon S3 + Amazon CloudFront      
* notifications - To integrate push notifications
* storage - To provide a simple mechanism for managing user content for your app in public, protected or private storage buckets.
* Interactions - To enable AI-powered chatbots


#### Integrate with AWS Amplify

- Install the dependencies
` npm install`
- Install aws-amplify and aws-amplify-react-native
```
npm install aws-amplify --save
npm install aws-amplify-react-native --save
```
- Set up your backend
You can quickly create your backend from scratch with Automatic Setup, using `amplify init`
```
? Choose your default editor: << choose-your-preferred editor >>
? Choose the type of app that you're building javascript
Please tell us about your project
? What javascript framework are you using react-native
? Source Directory Path:  src
? Distribution Directory Path: dist
? Build Command:  npm run-script build
? Start Command: npm run-script start
? Do you want to use an AWS profile? Yes
? Please choose the profile you want to use default
```
- Then push the configuration to build the resources
` amplify push`
When pushing the configuration, a configuration file for your app is put in your configured source directory called aws-exports.js
- Update your App.js to import Amplify and the configuration
```
import Amplify from 'aws-amplify';
import aws_exports from './src/aws-exports';
Amplify.configure(aws_exports)
```
- Run your application
` npm run android # npm run ios`

### Lesson 2 Adding Authentication using AWS Amplify
1. Add the authentication component to your AWS environment, Cognito, using AWS Amplify

- Add Cognito in your backend using Amplify CLI
` amplify auth add`
- Then push the configuration to build the resources and build it in AWS
` amplify push`

2. Using Authenticator Component

For React and React Native apps, the simplest way to add authentication flows into your app is to use withAuthenticator High Order Component. 

withAuthenticator automatically detects the authentication state and updates the UI. If the user is signed in, the underlying component (typically your appâ€™s main component) is displayed otherwise signing/signup controls is displayed.

- Configure your application
```
import { withAuthenticator } from 'aws-amplify-react-native';
...
export default withAuthenticator(App); # export default withAuthenticator(class App extends React.Component {
```
The withAuthenticator component adds Sign Up, Sign In with MFA and Sign Out capabilites to your app out of box.
Now, your app has complete flows for user sign-in and registration. Since you have wrapped your App with withAuthenticator, only signed in users can access your app. The routing for login pages and giving access to your App Component will be managed automatically.

3. Use your own Components + Amplify API calls

You can build your own UI Components and the API calls using Amplify. You would need to include:

- `import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';`
Using the AWS Amplify Auth API Calls:

- SignIn
```
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

Auth.signIn(username, password)
    .then(user => console.log(user))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));

// If MFA is enabled, sign-in should be confirmed with the congirmation code
// `user` : Return object from Auth.signIn()
// `code` : Confirmation code  
// `mfaType` : MFA Type e.g. SMS, TOTP.
Auth.confirmSignIn(user, code, mfaType)
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

- SignUp
```
import { Auth } from 'aws-amplify';

Auth.signUp({
    username,
    password,
    attributes: {
        email,          // optional
        phone_number,   // optional - E.164 number convention
        // other custom attributes 
    },
    validationData: []  //optional
    })
    .then(data => console.log(data))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));

// After retrieveing the confirmation code from the user
Auth.confirmSignUp(username, code, {
    // Optional. Force user confirmation irrespective of existing alias. By default set to True.
    forceAliasCreation: true    
}).then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.log(err));
  ```
- For complete list of API calls, refer to [Reac Native Documentation}(https://aws-amplify.github.io/amplify-js/media/authentication_guide)

### Lesson 3 Adding Cloud Storage capabilities using AWS Amplify

1. Add the storage component to your AWS environment using AWS Amplify

You can either implement a storage for content (Images, audio, video...) or a NoSQL database.

` amplify storage add`

Select the appropriate options.

- Then push the configuration to build the resources and build it in AWS
` amplify push`

2. Using the Amplify React Native Photo Picker Component

- Configure your application
``` 
Storage.put('yourFile.txt', 'your key', {
        level: 'private', //access control level
        contentType: 'text/plain' 
    })
    .then (result => console.log(result))
    .catch(err => console.log(err));
```

AWS Amplify Storage components provides API calls to:
- PUT
- GET
- REMOVE
- LIST
